If I make the python folder a submodule:
I will create a new repository for the python folder.
I will commit changes in the python folder to the new repository.
To update the submodule in gnr, I will run the following command outside of the python folder:
git submodule update --remote python

Simulate:
- Indirect reciprocity by forcing (not letting evolve) partner choice.
- Indirect reciprocity by starting from a high qB population.
- Only direct reciprocity.
